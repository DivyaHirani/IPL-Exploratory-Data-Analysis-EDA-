#üèè IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project using Python
Description:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The goal is to uncover key patterns, player/team performance insights, and match trends through detailed data exploration and visualization.

Key Objectives:

Understand the structure and distribution of IPL data.

Analyze player and team performance across seasons.

Identify winning strategies and trends in match outcomes.

Data Source:

Kaggle IPL dataset (matches.csv & deliveries.csv)

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

Key Analysis Performed:

Match Analysis:

Teams with highest batting and bowling averages

Innings & Strategy Insights:

Performance when batting first vs chasing

Powerplay vs death overs run comparison

Analysis of winning margins (by runs/wickets)

Visualizations:

Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, heatmaps

Season-wise and team-wise comparison charts

Correlation heatmap for feature insights

Insights & Outcomes:

Identified teams with consistent performance across seasons.

Found key players who had significant impact on team success.

Discovered tactical trends like winning toss vs winning match.

Delivered data-driven insights useful for fans, analysts, and fantasy league strategies.

Use Case:
